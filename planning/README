solve a planning problem under uncertain yield,demand\
First try a problem with 4 first stage binary 4 second stage binary
finish the planning problem with 3 scenarios. Did not do any branch and bound on
 the first stage variables. No basic step applied for the first and second scenario.
 all the basic step applied for the third scenario. 
The algorithm is able to converge to the optimal solution
