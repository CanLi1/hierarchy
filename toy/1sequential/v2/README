in this folder we solve a relaxation of the problem in /home/canl1/work/hierarchy/toy 
in subz1.jl and subz2.jl we only have the disjunction over z1 or z2
it turns out the algorithm cannnot converge in both cases
the results are shown in z1.out and z2.out
using different disjunctions will yield different lower bounds
