Does not apply the basic step just use the convex hull reformulation of the GDP
However, the algorithm is still able to converge
some of the z_dot / lambda does not satisfy the integrality constraints
see the excel file
The dual multipliers are also different even though z_dot/lambda satisfy the integrality constraints
